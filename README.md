Sample Bottle Application
===

This application is an example web app written using Bottle. See the notes at [Python Web Programming](http://pwp.stevecassidy.net/) for
supporting material. 

The project uses [bottle](https://bottlepy.org) as a web framework
 and the [bottle-sqlite](https://bottlepy.org/docs/0.12/plugins/sqlite.html)
plugin to implement the database interface.
